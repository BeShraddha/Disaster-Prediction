# Disaster-Prediction
This website is basically meant for predicting different types of disaster with the help of machine learning algorithms.

User (or the people using internet) wants to know everything in just a glance of second. So, keeping this things in mind, this website is meant that will give the knowledge of disaster to user in just a single click.

User can have the option to know about different types of natural disaster. Some of them are:
  •	Forest Fire
  •	Cyclone
  •	Earthquake
  •	Tsunami
  •	Flood
Machine learning algorithms will be used when user wants to know the chances of happening of particular disaster. Like, if user wants to know the chances of occurring of forest fire in a particular region. So, they just need to give us information to website and they will know the result.
And at this point of time machine learning algorithms comes into picture. Based on that particular piece of information, machine tries to predict the chances of happening of disaster.

The piece of information that will be needed for predicting forest fire is:
  •	Temperature of particular area
  •	Humidity of that area
  •	Speed of wind
Based on this information, machine will show the result as the machine will already be trained from the dataset that will contain plethora of information related to these factors.
User can also have the option to grasp better knowledge to these natural disaster as there will be section that will contain all the basic information about that particular disaster.

This website contains one more important feature that will help the user to know that the particular text is related to disaster or not. Basically, this website will have one more section which will do Sentiment Analysis based on text which will be provided by us.
Based on the polarity rate of particular text, machine will do sentiment analysis and shows us the intensity of that text. If the polarity rate of the text is high and it contains the words related to disaster, then machine will predict that the text belongs to disaster or not.
