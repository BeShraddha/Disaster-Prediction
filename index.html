      <blockquote>A wildfire, wildland fire or rural fire is an uncontrolled fire in an area of  combustible vegetation occurring in rural areas. Depending on the type  of vegetation present, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically  as a brush fire, bushfire (in Australia), desert fire, forest fire, grass fire,  hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Many organizations  consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire, while wildland  fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland fire use  (WFU; these are also called monitored response fires).</blockquote>
